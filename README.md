## My take on an exercise project by TheOdinProject.com
A simple first to 5 game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Made using CSS, HTML, and Javascript, along with icons from Fontsawesome.com.

My takeaways :
  1. Got better at designing functions and modularizing problems.
  2. Learnt how to setup event listeners over multiple HTML elements. 
  3. How to use external stylesheets from Fontsawesome, Bootstrap, and the likes.
  4. Familiarity with overall CSS, arrangements and animations.
